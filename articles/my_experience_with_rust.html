            <h2>why i tried it</h2>
            <p>A friend of mine was actively pitching <code>Rust</code> as new shiny thing i should try. I am always in search for a better language for gamedev, and after a week of attempts on integrating <code>C++20</code> modules (faster compile and no headers), which totally failed* - bugs, ICEs, docs so bad that reading source is more useful, - i realized how much time i spend on <code>CMake</code> (and earlier <code>Make</code> - i love slashes btw), dependency management, resolving compiler differences and other non-programming stuff, and thought that maybe <code>Rust</code> - which is praised for tooling - could solve that.</p>
            <p>* <em>for the purpose of correctness, i revisited it and actually moved to modules - this time successfully</em></p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>NOTE: i do gamedev/GPUs. Web <code>Rust</code> is different. Kernel <code>Rust</code> is different.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <!-- NOTE: not anymore. You can still do it if you want. But i don't super-badly need it now -->
            <!-- <small>If you are a `Rust` dev, i would really appreciate code review of [it (link)](https://github.com/platonvin/lum-rs). Suggestions about compile times are especially welcome.</small> -->

            <p><code>Cargo</code> is a build system that i don't think much about (I like that). Tooling is amazing: <code>rust-analyzer</code>, <code>clippy</code>, <code>fmt</code> (<code>Rust</code> is the only language where a formatter almost does not annoy me), plus community tools like <code>cargo-asm</code> and lots of others.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>And <code>Rust</code> has a lot of nice features!</p>

            <li>stack traces (i basically don't use a debugger)</li>
            <li>built-in checks (out-of-bounds, alignment, overflows / zero-div). I wish they were more optional though</li>
            <li>No constructors (seriously, there are more constructors in <code>C++</code> than there are math subjects).<br />

            <h2>real info</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>my binary sizes went from ~600 KB to ~700 KB (compared to <code>C++</code>). Likely, due to a lot of implicit assertions<br />
            <em>btw, just removing thiserror and anyhow cut like ~100kb</em></li>
            <li>performance-wise nothing really changed: <code>Rust</code> is faster at low opt-levels (~2x faster (not precompiled std, i checked)), and on highest opt-levels the gap narrows (with gcc being slightly faster for <code>C++</code>).</li>
            <li>(incremental) compile times are ~4s for both languages for similar dev (some optimizations) build (hard to really compare, project structures are different), both noticeably hurt iteration speed (i developed a habit of basically not running my code at all for a very long time. But lsps compensate it).<br />
            For debug build, <code>Rust</code> can recompile in around a second, while <code>C++</code> (even with modules) might take from 3~8 seconds, depending on a change</li>
            </ul>
            <hr />
            <p><strong>Performance-wise, <code>Rust</code> is truly a rocket. But not all <code>Rust</code>.</strong></p>
            <p><code>C</code>-like <code>Rust</code> is a beast. Simple references and struct hierarchy forces you into code that produces insane assembly. Enums for polymorphism are just regular functions. However, wrap everything in <code>Option</code>s, <code>Rc</code> <code>Cell</code>s and <code>Box</code>es, <code>dyn trait</code>s, hashtables to fight borrow checker, and it's not so fast anymore.</p>

            <h2>negatives</h2>
            <p>Not sure if it clicked or not. I frequently wonder if I'm still missing a fundamental piece of <code>Rust</code> philosophy<br />
            I thought i understood move semantics and tried to utilize it only to get mismatch between drop (which takes <code>&amp;mut</code> and not <code>mut</code>) and the fact that i want to take out a thing from a struct. I had to either wrap it in <code>Option&lt;_&gt;</code> or use <code>MaybeUninit</code></p>
            <hr />
            <p>Gamedev needs safe code that does not fall under safe <code>Rust</code> quite often. And vice versa, actually - gamedev writes "unsafe" code that falls under safe <code>Rust</code> - there's a trend to trick the borrow checker using <code>Vec[index]</code> as "virtual memory" (effectively disabling a borrow checker via virtual memory)</p>
            <hr />
            <p>You are not always given control over things - other people decided you should <strong>not</strong> have it, and now you have a problem. You cannot just disable slice bound checks for a scope - rewriting ops with <code>proc_macro</code> wont modify called functions, custom wrapper is ugly and has the same scope problem, replacing <code>#[panic_hook]</code> with <code>unreachable_unchecked!()</code> is insanity.<br />
            It is absolutely possible to have fine-grain control in <code>Rust</code> - its just ugly, verbose and unreadable. You want "-ffast-math" in function? Good luck! You cant change it for dependencies, and have to use intrinsics*. Is it possible? Sure, but you better off code it in <code>C</code> and link with LTO. Or just code in <code>C</code>.<br />
            * not literally intrinsics, but methods that call intrinsics. They are not overloaded.<br />
            <br />
            Sometimes i feel like people have joined a cult of "no unsafe <strike>code</strike>"<br />
            no unsafe != what you dream about code doing. Unsafe != incorrect. Unsafe is just a marker that demands explicit acknowledgement.<br />
            good luck turning off integer zero division checks. Or forcing <code>-ffast-math</code>. Or turning asserts into debug_assert<br />
            someone literally decided "oh thats too unsafe, <code>Rust</code> programmers are idiots and we should not even have this as opt-in option". It is probably fixable with a custom MIR pass.</p>
            <hr />
            <p><code>Rust</code> is not really good with math - you need big libraries for basic quaternions and matrices, and syntax is still ugly.<br />
            There is <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nalgebra"><code>nalgebra</code></a>. And <a href="https://crates.io/crates/glam"><code>glam</code></a>. And <a href="https://crates.io/crates/vek"><code>vek</code></a>. And <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cgmath"><code>cgmath</code></a>. And dozen more libraries. And custom vector solutions everywhere.<br />
            Linear algebra vectors map closely to hw. But we do not have builtin types for them somehow?? - oh but not every CPU has SIMD - yes they do, your browser likely requires at least SSE2 to run. Just to read this sentence. And we had floats before <code>ieee754</code>!</p>
            <p>Imagine if every <code>Rust</code> crate implemented floats manually. There would be floats with usize, with u32, with different endians, and some would be generic over this, some would be generated in build script while others generate in proc/declarative macro, or are written manually. Some would do inline assembly, some would be purely safe, ... Imagine that hell. That is what is going on with vectors.</p>
            <p>Its also pain to do as u32 as usize as u64 as isize ... all the time. Serialize as u32, usize for performance, u64 for GAPI</p>

            <section id="libraries-ecosystem" class="level2">
            <h2>libraries &amp; ecosystem</h2>
            <p>There is just not that many great libraries. Initializing <code>OpenGL</code> with <code>winit</code> and <code>glow</code> is harder than with <code>GLFW</code> (I literally spent few hours figuring it out). Algebra libraries are written by people who don't seem to code at all (compile times, syntax, hello?). <code>Vulkan</code> wrappers changing API and names dealt me pain. A popular <code>gltf</code> loader is more complicated than thermodynamics. I couldn't figure out the <code>MagicaVoxel (.vox)</code> parser docs and ended up porting the <code>C</code> parser instead (spent less time on that, huh).</p>
            <p>In <code>Rust</code> you don't spend a day trying to make a library compile &amp; link - you spend a day looking for one that doesn't suck. Crates refactor every few months and break APIs for no practical reason (semantic versioning - 1.0.0 - should help, but most crates are never gonna reach it). Documentation is often useless (says a lot, explains nothing), and logic is smeared across dozen layers of tiny functions (std has better docs, but suffers from unreadable source more).</p>
            <p>After reading docs, even when i feel like i understand most parts of the system, i usually have no idea how they connect to each other. Like std::random - i spent way too much time for something i would type in a minute in C. RandomSource? Great, i understand it. Distribution? Sure. How they connect? No idea. Feels like <code>Rust</code> libraries are written for people who understand the problem library is trying to solve. But this is why i use a library in the first place - if i understood the problem well, i would not need a library.<br />
            I really miss <code>C</code> libraries where you go to function source and immediately understand what it is doing. And libraries pull dozens of dependencies (which is not a problem by itself, but ...).</p>
            <hr />
            <p>You will have a problem, and there <strong>will</strong> be 3 crates with zero comparison between them, 10 feature flags each, no examples and with documentation like</p>
            <pre><code>/// A struct representing an apple
struct Apple {
    /// Seeds of this apple
    seeds: Vec&lt;Seed&gt; 
}</code></pre>
            <p>and you will dive through entirety of docs.rs and understand NOTHING</p>
            <p>Libraries tend to have a lot of asserts that are not disableable. Each one is truly nothing, but having them everywhere prevents compiler from reordering and "cancelling out" code. And also bloats your binaries.</p>
            <p>Lots of public <code>Rust</code> is for web, but web people do not bother telling you about that right away. They also have a very specific measure of performance</p>

I enjoy it, my code usually works first try, project structure feels better (i like to imagine that my code is an "opus magnum" (game) solution, multiple small mechanical pieces, moving and modifying data in a perfect tandem, except its far from perfect).</p>
